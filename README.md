# Creating My Brand for Engineering Projects

This README outlines the steps I followed to establish a unique brand for my engineering projects, centered around aerospace themes.

## 1. Theme Selection
The first step was to select a cohesive theme that could guide the naming conventions of both the brand and its associated projects. Given my focus on aerospace engineering, I chose "space" as the overarching theme. To refine this idea further, I opted for "Stars" as a more specific motif.

## 2. Brand Name
With the theme in place, I needed to find a name that captured the essence of stars and the processes that power them. The concept of "nuclear fusion," the primary energy source for stars, resonated with me. Fusion involves the combination of nuclei to form a new nucleus. After considering various suffixes like technologies, corporation, and engineering tech, I decided on "Space" as the ideal descriptor. Thus, the brand name "Fusion Space" was born.

## 3. Color Palette
Inspired by the stellar classification system, I turned to the corresponding Wikipedia page to derive a color palette. Using an eyedropper tool in Adobe, I extracted colors directly from the Harvard spectral classification chart available online. This process helped me establish a visually appealing and relevant color scheme for the brand. The Harvard spectral classification chart form Wikipedia is below: ![image](https://github.com/ndp0021/Creating-my-brand/assets/135655563/43ee6405-5c61-4b9e-9a42-91fa2735dd05)

## 4. Logo Design
To design the logo, I drew inspiration from the appearance of stars in the night sky. I initially gathered ideas from various images found on Google, then used SolidWorks—a tool I am comfortable with—to create a preliminary version of the logo. Although unconventional, SolidWorks allowed me to experiment freely. I exported the initial design as a DXF file, converted it to an SVG online, and then finalized it in Adobe Illustrator. Here, I refined the paths, applied a gradient, and removed outlines. I chose vibrant colors from the palette, starting with a light orange-red (representing the lowest temperature in the stellar classification) and transitioning to blue (the highest temperature). The brand name "FusionSpace" was styled in Cascadia Mono font without spacing to add a modern touch, and the same gradient was applied to the text, positioned under the logo for a cohesive look. Below is the final logo with no background: ![FusionSpaceNoBackground](https://github.com/ndp0021/Creating-my-brand/assets/135655563/bb95c3bb-28e6-4eac-b5e9-f3c4b0375020)

## 5. Project Naming Scheme
In keeping with the stellar theme, I decided to name the projects after officially recognized stars. Using an Excel file from the International Astronomical Union (IAU) listing named stars, I developed a Python script with a tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI features a simulated spinning wheel to randomly select star names, offering a creative and thematic way to designate project titles.
